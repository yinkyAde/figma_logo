# Animated Figma Logo in Flutter

This project demonstrates how to **recreate and animate the Figma logo** in Flutter using only `CustomPainter` and `AnimationController`.  
The animation includes a smooth **3D-like spin** of the top pill and **sequential fade-ins and fade-outs** of the other logo parts.

---

## Features
- **Accurate Figma Logo** built with Flutter's `Canvas` and `RRect` primitives.
- **3D Spin Effect** on the top pill (Row 1).
- **Sequential Animations**:
  - Row 2 Left (Purple half-pill)
  - Row 2 Right (Blue circle)
  - Row 3 (Green droplet)
- **Looping Cycle** with smooth easing (`Curves.easeInOutCubic`).
- Built entirely with Flutter â€” no images or assets.
